# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Project Overview:
  
  We conducted an analysis on Pewlett Hackard (PH) company's employees to find out about its soon to be retired employees, their titles and also candidates for a mentoship program. In the mentorship program, the retiring employees will take part time roles to train the new recruits so the company's operations keep running smoothly.
